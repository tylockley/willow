This is especially true in Greek literature, whereas in others they are merely alluded to. &nbsp;Texts that have religious influence as a motif include </span><span class="c0">The Odyssey</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;by Homer, </span><span class="c0">The Ramayana of Valmiki by</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Valmiki, and </span><span class="c0">Beowulf, </span><span class="c1">written by a pre-medieval, anonymous Anglo-Saxon and translated by Seamus Heaney. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">T</span><span class="c2">hrough close examination of these texts, the involvement of gods and their effect on the hero&rsquo;s glory contributes to the overall meaning of the epic. This is done through the gods questioning the hero&rsquo;s true ability and</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">incentivizing honorable deeds to receive divine favor. This dissuades disrespect to virtues of a given culture and creates ideal citizens through exaggerated examples of heroism. </span><span class="c1">It can also be seen as a form of religious propaganda. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">The argument that god&#39;s ultimately affected the outcome of a hero&rsquo;s journey first begs the question of who the glory belongs to. &nbsp;Is it that of the hero, or that of the god who favors them? &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The Odyssey</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is a prime example of this dilemma. &nbsp;Whenever Odysseus is thrown off course to his return to Ithaca by the wrath of Poseidon, Athena is always there to assist him, as seen when &ldquo;she sent a crackling through the waves, a tailwind for Odysseus until he was safe on Phaeacia&rdquo; (Homer 394: 388-389). &nbsp;Countless times throughout the text she appears to give him strength, endurance, and even beauty so that he will regain the upper hand. &nbsp;Sometimes Odysseus is aware of her presence; most times he is not. &nbsp;Odysseus is a prideful man who constantly boasts of his glory. &nbsp;Yet, after examining how prevalent Athena is in his times of weakness, is Odysseus really justified to make such assertions? </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">The reader is granted glimpses&rsquo; into Olympus where the Assembly of gods meet to discuss mortal affairs, and can see how Athena relentlessly fights for Odysseus&rsquo; favor: &ldquo;let&rsquo;s all put our heads together and find a way to bring Odysseus home&rdquo; (Homer 334: 83-83). &nbsp;Is this affection towards her favorite mortal, or a means to achieve a selfish pursuit? Is Odysseus her pawn to achieve a higher ranking in the assembly? &nbsp; She continues with &ldquo;Poseidon will have to put aside his anger. &nbsp;He can&rsquo;t hold out alone against the will of all the immortals&rdquo; (Homer 334: 85-86). &nbsp;The reader is already aware of tensions between Athena and Poseidon, and by convincing the favoring of Odysseus she can possess more power than Poseidon. &nbsp;So, is it Odysseus&rsquo; glory or Athena&rsquo;s? The arguments are endless.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">The same question can be asked in regards to </span><span class="c0">Beowulf</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;Whenever Beowulf defeats a monster and is praised, he immediately turns the praise towards God for having turned fate to his advantage. &nbsp;After defeating Grendel&rsquo;s mother, Beowulf admits that &ldquo;it was hard-fought, a desperate affair that could have gone badly; if God had not helped me&rdquo; (Heaney 150: 1656-1657). But God is not an active, verbally present figure like the gods in </span><span class="c0">The Odyssey</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;God is only present in the allusions Beowulf and his comrades make. &nbsp;This makes the question posed more difficult to answer since the Geats deliberately relinquish their glory to an entity who &ndash; from a literary perspective &ndash; is not present enough to be considered even a static character. &nbsp;God in </span><span class="c0">Beowulf </span><span class="c1">is strictly a religious motif that affects the outcome of the story purely based on the belief system of the culture. &nbsp;The Geats contribute God&rsquo;s favor to the nature of their Christianity in that God will assist believers and condemn monsters &ndash; or non-believers. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">The ambiguity of glory in </span><span class="c0">The Ramayana </span><span class="c2">is less apparent. &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The Ramayana </span><span class="c2">is a Hindu epic, as there is a hero and a journey that tests him on his devotion to dharma. &nbsp;It is immediately apparent that Rama is greatly devoted to dharma, even though the numerous trials he is put through are less than fair; &ldquo;I shall go, and I myself will gladly give away to my brother Bharata the kingdom, wealth, Sita, and even my own life, and it is easier when all this is done in obedience to my father&rsquo;s command&rdquo; (Valmiki 1177). &nbsp;He is even willing to relinquish Sita as his wife after the trials of regaining her on the assumption that she might have been unfaithful in her forced absence. &nbsp;But, the truth that he is Vishnu ascended to Earth (unbeknownst to himself) to set an example of a righteous man ridding an evil king, discredits his glory. &nbsp;Since he was not a true mortal but a god, the question of whose glory it is is clouded since, in </span><span class="c0">The Ramayana</span><span class="c2">, man </span><span class="c0">was</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;god. &nbsp;However, through the lenses of religious motifs, it can be concluded that, regardless of whose glory it is, relationships with gods results in divine favor. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Favors in divine relationships beg another question when glory is examined under religious influence. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">All three heroes are repeatedly described as &ldquo;godlike,&rdquo; but if the gods were not present, could the hero&#39;s still be glorious? &nbsp;In </span><span class="c0">The Ramayana</span><span class="c2">, there&rsquo;s an exception. Since Rama actually is Vishnu, he naturally possesses godly traits. But in the case of &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The Odyssey</span><span class="c2">, the evidence of highly active divine intervention strongly suggests the protagonists would be weaker without the gods. &nbsp;Odysseus certainly possesses hubris, and without Athena&rsquo;s salvation, he would be the prime example of a tragic hero &ndash; unable to boast about his strenghts. &nbsp;Yet in</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Beowulf,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;since God is only alluded to, Beowulf seemingly achieves his glory through his own strength alone. &nbsp;But to examine the true strength of the heroes, their agency must be considered. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">A character&rsquo;s agency is their free will in a defined world. When considering religious motifs, that world is defined by the laws of their religion. &nbsp;In </span><span class="c0">The Odyssey</span><span class="c1">, Odysseus has little to no agency. &nbsp;From what that the reader sees in the Assembly of Olympus, it is evident that the gods play a large role in determining the fate of men, and if Odysseus or any other mortal is able to see a result from an action of their own &ndash; without any divine intervention &ndash; it is still because the gods have allowed this. &nbsp;Therefore, the gods of Greek polytheistic religion have absolute power, and the concept of agency is merely an illusion to men. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">The opposite is seen in </span><span class="c0">Beowulf</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;The idea that their world is defined by religious laws is an illusion created by their fellow men on the basis of successive faith. Since the Geats are not aware of their freedom, the influence religious laws have over the text cannot be overlooked. &nbsp;In </span><span class="c0">The Ramayana</span><span class="c2">, agency is present in Rama and the other characters, but since Rama does not know he is a god, this makes the situation unique.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">The reader cannot blame Rama&rsquo;s perfection on his divinity since it is evident in the text that is unknown to him: &ldquo;I consider myself a human being, Rama the son of Dasaratha. &nbsp;Who I am, and whence I am, may you tell me&rdquo; (Valmiki 1230). &nbsp; Additionally, since the pedestal of Hinduism is dharma, the complete agency of men is crucial to religious laws. &nbsp;By having one&rsquo;s actions be of their own accord, this determines their karma, and thus the whole social hierarchy of Indian culture. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Now that divine involvement has been shown to determine the glory of the hero and the outcome of the epic, the religious motif itself must be examined. &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The Odyssey, Beowulf,</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0">The Ramayana </span><span class="c1">are all epics in their own right. &nbsp;Since the nature of an epic is to narrate the history of a culture (or nation) in a style that exemplifies their values, it is not surprising that religion plays such a dominant role. &nbsp;These texts were all composed in times before the idea of nationalized politics had taken effect. &nbsp;In a way, religion was ancient politics. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">The reader sees councils and assemblies in Olympus that mimic the democracy of ancient Greeks. &nbsp;Obviously, divinity is higher than mortality, and in Greek culture, despite all their advancements in government, the gods remained highest in power and properly worshipped so to discourage their wrath. &nbsp; In </span><span class="c0">The Ramayana, </span><span class="c1">dharma and karma governs as a system that rewards men by their cooperation and devotion. &nbsp;Valmiki even concludes the text with the promise that &ldquo;he who listens to it always is freed from all sins&rdquo; (Valmiki 1234). &nbsp;Divine relationships result in divine favors &ndash; leading to a higher status in society. &nbsp;Therefore, the purpose of religious overplay is to convince people to achieve a demeanor similar to those presented in their epics, since they are written in accordance with their values. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">This is a rather deceptive way to ensure order, but one that speaks to men who, as a species, are notoriously susceptible to evil. &nbsp;Honor whatever noun implies religious law, be it dharma, or glory, or servitude, and good things will come. &nbsp;This assumption is proved even further in </span><span class="c0">Beowulf</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;When examining the stylistic tone of the piece there are insertions of Christianity that appear outside of plot relevance and serve only to justify the actions of the Geats. &nbsp;Considering that </span><span class="c0">Beowulf </span><span class="c1">existed first as an oral story in a time when Paganism was popular, the Christian insertions truly mark the text for what they are: a form of religious propaganda. &nbsp;The Geats muse how &ldquo;it is a great wonder how Almighty God in His magnificence favors our race with rank and scope and the gift of wisdom&rdquo; (Heaney 151: 1724-1727). Meanwhile, Grendel is a descendant of Cain, who was outcasted by God and is described as a monster who possesses Paganistic traits. However, Beowulf and his comrades are all Christians, who, according to the text, possess a superior status to other men or creatures. &nbsp; Is it then surprising who triumphs in the end? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">The purpose of religious propaganda in epics is thus to convince or convert through example. &nbsp;This is important for readers and historians alike to examine such techniques of artful manipulation that have survived into contemporary times. &nbsp;While epics are rare in contemporary literature, religious propaganda is still present in global cultures. Each religion is convinced their beliefs possess ultimate truths and use their religious documents to support their claims and as evidence to justify their actions. &nbsp;In current times this can primarily be seen in the Middle East concerning Islam. &nbsp;However, by lack of a thorough understanding of such texts, misinterpretations arise, and with that, conflict between nations. &nbsp;This calls for the importance of widespread knowledge concerning ancient texts. In understanding how religion has been used as a means of propaganda since the beginning of documented time, the influences can be seen in countless areas of our culture. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c15"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c15"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Works Cited</span></p><p class="c5 c11"><span class="c2 c12">Puchner, Martin, editor. </span><span class="c0 c12">The Norton Anthology of World Literature.</span><span class="c6 c2">&nbsp;Third ed., A, W.
